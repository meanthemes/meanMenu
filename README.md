MeanMenu v2.0.6
===========

Looking for a WordPress version?
---
Our friends over at PluginHero have just released the <a href="http://pluginhero.com/portfolio/meanmenu/">WordPress version of MeanMenu</a>. 

A menu system for converting a standard menu into a mobile/tablet responsive menu, media query independent.

**Please note: This is not a menu system replacement. It is simply a lightweight piece of jQuery to convert a standard navigation into a mobile/tablet navigation.**

**If you are looking for drop down functionality on the desktop, MeanMenu doesn't do it. Use <a title="Superfish Drop down menus" href="http://plugins.jquery.com/superfish/">Superfish</a> as well as MeanMenu. You can see Superfish + MeanMenu on all of our themes, for exampleÂ <a title="Literary Theme" href="http://www.meanthemes.com/theme/literary/">Literary</a>.**

And yes, it works with jQuery 2.0 - obviously IE 7 & 8 will not work.

Live Demo:
<a href="http://www.meanthemes.com/demo/meanmenu/demo.html">http://www.meanthemes.com/demo/meanmenu/demo.html</a>


Just include the jQuery library (http://jquery.com) 

Then this file (jquery.meanmenu.js)

in your HTML e.g.

    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.js"></script> 
    <script src="assets/js/plugins/jquery.meanmenu.js"></script> 
    
Then add the CSS for this after all of your other CSS in the &lt;head&gt; section.

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="meanmenu.css" media="all" />

Then in your usual document.ready, this is working under the assumption your navigation is in &lt;header>&lt;nav> structure...

    jQuery(document).ready(function () {
    	jQuery('header nav').meanmenu();
    });

There are the following options (Options are shown with their defaults)...
