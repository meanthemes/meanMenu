A menu system for converting a standard menu into a mobile/tablet responsive menu, media query independent.

**Please note: This is not a menu system replacement. It is simply a lightweight piece of jQuery to convert a standard navigation into a mobile/tablet navigation.**

If you are looking for drop down functionality on the desktop, MeanMenu doesn't do it. Use <a title="Superfish Drop down menus" href="http://plugins.jquery.com/superfish/">Superfish</a> as well as MeanMenu.

Just include the jQuery library (http://jquery.com)

Then this file (jquery.meanmenu.js)

in your HTML e.g.

    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.js"></script>
    <script src="jquery.meanmenu.js"></script>

Then add the CSS for this after all of your other CSS in the &lt;head&gt; section.

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="meanmenu.css" media="all" />

Then in your usual document.ready, this is working under the assumption your navigation is in <header><nav> structure...

    jQuery(document).ready(function () {
    	jQuery('header nav').meanmenu();
    });

There are the following options (Options are shown with their defaults)...

meanMenuContainer: 'body'

- Choose where meanmenu will be placed within the HTML

meanBarColour: '#0c1923'

- set colour for the bar background

meanNavColour: 'inherit'

- set colour for the nav background

meanMenuClose: "x"

- Single character you want to represent the close menu button

meanMenuOpen: "â‰¡"

- Single character you want to represent the open menu button

meanRevealPosition: "right"

- Left right or center positions

meanRevealPositionDistance: "0"

- Tweak the position of the menu

meanRevealColour: "none"

- set colour for the reveal background

meanScreenWidth: "640"

- Set the screen width you want meanmenu to kick in at

meanNavPush: false

- Set a height here in px, em or % if you want to budge your layout now the navigation is missing.

meanShowChildren: true

- true to show children in the menu, false to hide them

meanExpandableChildren: true

- true to allow expand/collapse children

meanExpand: "+"

- single character you want to represent the expand for ULs

meanContract: "-"

- single character you want to represent the contract for ULs

meanRemoveAttrs: false
- true to remove classes and IDs, false to keep them

onePage: false

- set to true for one page sites, the navigation will close back up on itself on click

removeElements: null

- enter comma separated values in here of elements you want hidden from the container of meanmenu e.g. if you had a search box called .search, enter ".search" in here

meanDisplay: "block"

- by default this is block, sometimes you may want to switch this to table or table-cell or inline-block etc. so now you can.
